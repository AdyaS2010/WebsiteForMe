            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, hello!!! I'm Adya S, a passionate and driven high school student with a strong commitment to making a positive impact in my community! As an active member of various clubs and leadership positions (including NJHS), I am dedicated to upholding the values of scholarship, leadership, service, and character. I am currently developing a Volunteering App designed to connect high school students with meaningful volunteer opportunities tailored to their interests. This project, built using React on the Replit platform, aims to simplify the process of finding and participating in volunteer work, making it easier for students to contribute to causes they care about, based off of individual as well as collective experiences of those around me and in the same boat. In addition to my work on the Volunteering App, I am also exploring my creativity through several other Projects (details to come soon), where I am learning to code and design interactive features! My goal is to create engaging and educational content that inspires others to explore the world of programming, just as the powerhouse of an organization like HackClub allowed me to do. I believe in the power of community service and the importance of giving back. Through my projects and volunteer work, I strive to make a difference and encourage others to do the same. When I'm not coding or volunteering, you can find me enjoying a good book, playing sports, or spending time with family and friends! :D</p>
            <p>Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals and making a positive impact together!</p>
